## Hatch.es API

## Mobile Fly Fishing Tools

 Track your angling success on-stream with offline fisheries maps and
automatically correlate GPS information with weather, hydrology, hatch activity, and other custom data that you collect
_**without interrupting your cast.**_

Shoot a video of your buddy catching a fish deep in the backwoods and we can have it posted to your fly fishing journal
before you get home. Keep it a secret forever, show it to that buddy of yours, or share it with the world. **It is up to you.**

### _The_ premium app for hardcore fly anglers

### Cultivate fly fishing knowledge using real data.

There is a lot of mythology in the sport of fly fishing, and much of it is accepted as sanctified wisdom, but there is precious little
empirical data available We are building a data collection and reporting service for fly fishers who want facts, not fables. Take
control of your fly fishing, and catch more fish!

## Learn the terrain.

Automatically log geospatial information **while fishing.** When you land a fish, take a picture and it will be
tagged with your geolocation so you can track what really works on the water. Plan your fishing trip using informative mobile
maps and plot your activities on the map as you fish. You will then be able to review and analyze all of your journal's
information to help you catch more fish.

### Keep it secret, or pay it forward; The choice is yours.

You can keep your favorite spots private to protect sensitive fisheries, you can share some reports with your friends, and you
can post public data
if you like. Your privacy is important, and the conservation of our most pristine waters is perhaps more so. We don't, and never
will share your posts or personal information with any third party without your explicit permission, we don't roll like that.

### You don't have to be experienced, just enthusiastic.

We want to help the aspiring fly angler who doesn't know a coachman from a humpy to pick the right fly, and the jaded veteran
trout bum to dig even deeper with flexible reporting tools to find new answers to old questions. Maybe our public data
API service will benefit science someday. **Did I mention it's free?** The data API is free for everyone, the mobile apps will cost an
undetermined pittance to keep us from living _in a van down by the river._ Come to think of it, that doesn't sound too bad.
