                            to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven
                            of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm
                            breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't.

                        <p>

                        <p> Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull
                            this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you.
                            But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through
                            too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.
                        </p>

                        <p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with
                            my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face
                            sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No?
                            Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because
                            you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.
                        </p>

                            Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
                            gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go

                        My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there,
                        and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there.
                        Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
                        gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go
                        in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to
                        get shot. You understand?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows
                        it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week
                        to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven
                        of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm
                        breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't.
                        Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

                    <p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with
                        my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face
                        sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No?
                        Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because
                        you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.
